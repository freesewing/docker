## What am I looking at? 🤔


**This repo is currently de-facto abondoned**

This repository was intended to hold Docker images to facilitate 
development on/for FreeSewing.

However, there's not a lot of demand for this:

 - People who know how to run a Docker container also know how to setup 
their development environment
 - People who don't know how to run a Docker container aren't helped by this

Still, we are keeping this repo here because it would be *nice to have* at some point.


## Getting started ⚡ 

There's some Docker images here, but they are outdated.  
If you would like to make use of them, [create an issue](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new) and
we will see whether we can revive this effort.

## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

Our [core library](https://freesewing.dev/) is a *batteries-included* toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. It's a modular system (check our list
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/plugins) and getting started is as simple as:

```bash
npm init freesewing-pattern
```

We also have [a template repository](https://github.com/freesewing/pattern) if you prefer to start that way.

Developer documentation is maintained on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) and
we also have a `#development-help` channel on [Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/).

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) where you can generate
our sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.

FreeSewing is an open source project run by a community,
