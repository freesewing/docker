# FreeSewing docker images

This is currently abandoned.
However, the idea was to provide a bunch of docker images that would
make it easy for people to start working on/developing with FreeSewing.

However, there's not a ton of demand for this stuff (in the sense that
people who know how to run a Docker container also know how to setup 
their development environment themselves, and people who don't know
how to run a Docker container aren't really helped by this.

Still, we are keeping this repo here because it would be *nice to have*
at some point.
